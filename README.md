Fatal accidents are caused due to high beam of headlights. Though there is a conventional automatic headlight dimmer it becomes futile when there is fast moving traffic in opposite lane. Our project mainly focuses on reducing the accidents caused due to headlight glare by introducing Vehicle to Vehicle(V2V) communication and Eye tracker. Oncoming vehicle headlight is dimmed automatically based on the inputs from the eye tracker. Transmission works based on VANET in this prototype.
